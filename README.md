The repository hosts Helm Charts for my Argo CD example.

# Usage

Helm must be installed to use the charts. Please refer to Helmâ€™s documentation to get started.

Once Helm is set up properly, add the repo as follows:

```
helm repo add mapspiral https://mapspiral.github.io/example-argocd-charts
```

If you had already added this repo earlier, run helm repo update to retrieve the latest versions of the packages.

You can then run `helm search repo mapspiral` to see the charts.
